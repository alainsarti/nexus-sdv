Welcome to the Nexus SDV ecosystem. This guide is designed to take you from a fresh repository to a fully functional connected vehicle cloud backend in just a few logical steps. Whether you are an architect evaluating the framework or a developer building custom services, the following sections provide the technical foundation and hands-on instructions needed to succeed.

## The Path to Your Own Platform

Follow these four steps to deploy, connect, and extend your Nexus instance:

## Preview: Interactive Online Documentation

While this GitHub-based documentation provides the core technical steps, we are currently finalizing a comprehensive, interactive documentation portal at **docs.nexus-sdv.io**.

The upcoming portal will offer a significantly enhanced user experience, including global search, and a streamlined navigation flow.

> **Note on Content Rendering:** > The upcoming online documentation is developed with **Astro**. Consequently, you may notice specific formatting tags (such as `:::tip` or `:::note`). While these appear as plain text here on GitHub, they will be rendered as color-coded callout boxes in the final online version.
