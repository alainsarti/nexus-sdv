# Sample Services

These sample services demonstrate how custom services can be developed on top of Nexus.

In this first release, we show you how to integrate with the Data-API, which is the main connector between services and vehicle data.

Looking ahead, we are actively developing sample services that implement the **AI Assistant showcase** first presented at **IAA Mobility 2025**. You can view the corresponding video of this vision in action on our **[Nexus SDV landing page](https://www.valtech.com/industries/mobility/nexus-sdv-platform/)**.
