# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This directory contains the configurations and scripts required to deploy the Nexus infrastructure. 

The deployment is primarily automated leveraging **Terraform**, supported by **Shell scripts** and **Helm charts** for Kubernetes-based components. This ensures a standardized setup of the connected vehicle platform within your Google Cloud project.

Follow our **[Online Setup Guide](https://docs.nexus-sdv.io)** to get started with the platform deployment.
